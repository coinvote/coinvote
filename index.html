<p>CoinVote is a site where the 'shareholders' of Bitcoin can express their opinions about important topics affecting the bitcoin community and protocol. Satoshi's original vision was that proof-of-work would solve the problem of determining representation in majority decision making (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>). Unfortunately, with the invention of ASICs, mining pools, and mining farms, the users of bitcoin have had their voting powers stripped from them. Miner's can voice their opinions on important changes by running different software or including messages in the coinbase transaction, but it is incredibly difficult to understand how the shareholders of Bitcoin feel through the noise and censorship of communities like r/Bitcoin.</p>

<p>CoinVote is a way for holders of bitcoin to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics. We believe that the owners of bitcoin are the most important contingent in the bitcoin ecosystem and we want their voices to be heard. We believe in a 'one Satoshi-one vote' policy. A sort of 'proof-of-stake' methodology for policy decision making.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
