{"name":"Coinvote","tagline":"one Satoshi one vote","body":"### Welcome to CoinVote.\r\nCoinVote is a site where the 'shareholders' of Bitcoin can express their opinions about important topics affecting the bitcoin community and protocol. Satoshi's original vision was that proof-of-work would solve the problem of determining representation in majority decision making (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Unfortunately, with the invention of ASICs, mining pools, and mining farms, the users of bitcoin have had their voting powers stripped from them. Miner's can voice their opinions on important changes by running different software or including messages in the coinbase transaction, but it is incredibly difficult to understand how the shareholders of Bitcoin feel through the noise and censorship of communities like r/Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n### What is CoinVote?\r\nCoinVote is a way for holders of bitcoin to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics. We believe that the owners of bitcoin are the most important contingent in the bitcoin ecosystem and we want their voices to be heard. We believe in a 'one Satoshi-one vote' policy. A sort of 'proof-of-stake' methodology for policy decision making.\r\n\r\n### How Does it Work?\r\nCoinVote works by allowing users to 'voice their vote' through the use of digital signatures. A user creates a signed message through the wallet of their choice and casts their vote on the CoinVote website. The CoinVote server than verifies that the signed message is valid and casts a vote for the user's bitcoin address. Periodically the CoinVote server tallies the total number of bitcoins being held by the accounts on each side of the vote and renders a graphic displaying the results.\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Create a Signed Message?\r\nBitcoin Core (https://bitcoin.org/en/download)\r\nElectrum (https://bitcoinarmory.com/)\r\nArmory (https://bitcoinarmory.com/)\r\nBlockchain.info (https://blockchain.info/)\r\nCoinbase (https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1526413-how-do-i-sign-a-message-with-a-bitcoin-address-)\r\nand many more...\r\n\r\n### Created by\r\nKelly Olson @ineffectualproperty\r\n\r\nDean Pierce @pierce403\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
